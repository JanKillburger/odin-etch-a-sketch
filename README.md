# Etch a sketch

A simple sketch pad with a variable grid resolution.

## Usage

Hover your mouse over the sketch pad (indicated by black border) to color the grid squares. Hovering over already colored areas increases the opacity in 10 steps.

### Adjusting the grid

Click the top button and enter an integer to change the grid resolution. The higher the number, the finer the depiction of your cursor's path.
